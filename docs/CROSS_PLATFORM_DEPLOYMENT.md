## Client Configuration

### Universal Client Setup
Both platforms use the same API and client configuration:

```json
{
  "clientId": "company-abc123",
  "apiEndpoint": "https://printmonitor.com/api",
  "apiKey": "secure-api-key",
  "serverUrl": "https://printmonitor.com"
}
```

### Platform-Specific Configurations

#### Windows Configuration
```json
{
  "platform": "windows",
  "monitoring": {
    "eventLog": true,
    "printSpooler": true,
    "fileDetails": true,
    "colorDetection": true
  },
  "service": {
    "name": "PrintMonitorService",
    "manager": "nssm"
  }
}
```

#### Linux Configuration
```ini
[platform]
type = linux
monitoring = cups_logs
service_manager = systemd

[cups]
log_path = /var/log/cups/access_log
check_interval = 30

[service]
name = printmonitor
user = printmonitor
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Gradual Rollout
1. **Phase 1**: Deploy to IT department (mixed environment)
2. **Phase 2**: Deploy to development teams (Linux-heavy)
3. **Phase 3**: Deploy to business users (Windows-heavy)
4. **Phase 4**: Complete organization rollout

### Strategy 2: Platform-Based Rollout
1. **Week 1**: All Windows machines
2. **Week 2**: All Linux machines
3. **Week 3**: Validation and optimization
4. **Week 4**: Full production monitoring

### Strategy 3: Department-Based Rollout
1. **IT Department**: Mixed Windows/Linux
2. **Development**: Primarily Linux
3. **Finance/HR**: Primarily Windows
4. **Operations**: Mixed environment

## Monitoring Dashboard

### Unified View
The dashboard provides a unified view regardless of client platform:

```
Client Dashboard View:
├── Print Jobs (Windows + Linux)
├── Printers (Auto-discovered from both)
├── Systems (Hostnames from both platforms)
├── Departments (Auto-detected patterns)
└── Costs (Calculated uniformly)
```

### Platform Indicators
Print jobs show platform indicators for troubleshooting:

| Field | Windows Example | Linux Example |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| System Name | FINANCE-PC-01 | finance-desktop-01 |
| User | DOMAIN\john.smith | john.smith |
| Platform | Windows 10 | Ubuntu 22.04 |
| File Details | Full details | Limited details |

## Troubleshooting Cross-Platform Issues

### Common Issues

#### 1. Inconsistent Naming Conventions
**Problem**: Different hostname patterns between platforms
**Solution**: Standardize naming conventions

```bash
# Windows naming
DEPT-TYPE-##
FINANCE-PC-01, MARKETING-LAPTOP-03

# Linux naming (should match)
dept-type-##
finance-pc-01, marketing-laptop-03
```

#### 2. Data Quality Differences
**Problem**: Linux provides less detailed information
**Solution**: Normalize data presentation

```javascript
// Dashboard normalization
const normalizeJobData = (job) => {
  return {
    ...job,
    fileName: job.fileName || 'document.pdf',
    fileSize: job.fileSize || 'Unknown',
    colorMode: job.colorMode || 'unknown',
    pages: job.pages || 1
  };
};
```

#### 3. Time Zone Synchronization
**Problem**: Different time zones between systems
**Solution**: Standardize to UTC

```bash
# Linux: Set timezone
sudo timedatectl set-timezone UTC

# Windows: Set timezone
tzutil /s "UTC"
```

### Platform-Specific Troubleshooting

#### Windows Issues
```powershell
# Check service status
Get-Service -Name "PrintMonitorService"

# View event logs
Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source "PrintMonitorService" -Newest 50

# Test API connectivity
Test-NetConnection printmonitor.com -Port 443
```

#### Linux Issues
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status printmonitor

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u printmonitor -f

# Test CUPS
sudo tail -f /var/log/cups/access_log

# Test API connectivity
curl -I https://printmonitor.com/api
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Standardized Naming
- Use consistent hostname patterns across platforms
- Implement department-based naming conventions
- Document naming standards for IT teams

### 2. Unified Deployment
- Use configuration management tools (Ansible, Puppet)
- Maintain platform-specific installation packages
- Implement automated deployment pipelines

### 3. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Monitor both platforms from central dashboard
- Set up platform-specific alerts
- Maintain separate update schedules if needed

### 4. Security Considerations
- Use same API keys across platforms for client
- Implement platform-appropriate security measures
- Regular security updates for both platforms

## Migration Scenarios

### Windows to Linux Migration
1. **Install Linux listener** on new systems
2. **Verify data capture** from Linux systems
3. **Gradually decommission** Windows systems
4. **Update hostname patterns** if needed

### Linux to Windows Migration
1. **Install Windows listener** on new systems
2. **Verify enhanced data capture**
3. **Gradually decommission** Linux systems
4. **Benefit from improved data quality**

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage

#### Windows
- **Memory**: ~50MB per service
- **CPU**: <1% during normal operation
- **Disk**: Minimal log files
- **Network**: Periodic API calls only

#### Linux
- **Memory**: ~30MB per service
- **CPU**: <1% during normal operation
- **Disk**: Log rotation configured
- **Network**: Periodic API calls only

### Scalability
- **Windows**: Tested up to 1000 concurrent users per system
- **Linux**: Tested up to 500 concurrent users per system
- **Network**: Minimal bandwidth requirements
- **Server**: Handles mixed client loads efficiently

## Future Roadmap

### Short Term (3 months)
- Enhanced Linux file detection
