3 Printers per Client (15 total printers)
Isolated Data per client
Centralized Management dashboard
🚀 Next Steps for Deployment
Server Setup: Follow the deployment guide to set up your central server
Database Configuration: Run the SQL scripts to create client and printer records
Windows Listeners: Install the PowerShell monitoring service on each client's machines
API Keys: Generate unique API keys for each client

Starting print monitoring
The system is production-ready and will automatically populate with real data once the Windows listeners are installed and configured at each client location.
